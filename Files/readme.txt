Chicken Run Readme

Instructions

The game is deployed on Github pages, and should load as soon as you access the page. Everything is web based and does not need installation.


Goal

The initial goal was to create a game in the spirit of Mario, a platform that involves running and jumping to collect objects and eventually to win the game by getting to the end of the level. All in all it was pretty successful. While there are always more things add, it came out with all the necessary features and even a few extras.


Technologies

Chicken Run was created using Phaser 3, a game development framework that leverages either WebGL or Canvas depending on browser support. It was written in Javascript with HTML pages attached for each mode (single vs multiplayer) and CSS with bootstrap and flex box to style them.

Unsolved Problems

If I were to write another game using the same technologies I would begin with implementing "scenes" in the very beginning. By the time I realized how they worked it was late in development and would have taken forever to reorganize the game to utilize scenes.
